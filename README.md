# danyates.dev

You can view my personal website at [danyates.dev](https://danyates.dev). The website contains a very basic blog, some animations, and an [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) colour scheme and design.

This website was built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The static site generator [11ty](https://11ty.dev) was used, allowing me to quickly build out pages using custom Nunjucks templates.
